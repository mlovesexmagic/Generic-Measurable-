# Generic-Measurable-
A practice of using abstract generic in Java

- Make the a generic abstract class named Measurable.
- Provide a static method that returns the largest element of an ArrayList, provided that the elements are instances of Measurable. Be       sure to return a value of type T.
- Make your Measurable class implement Comparable also. In your tester, create an ArrayList of your Measurable objects, use the    
  Collections.sort() to sort the objects then print them out in sorted order.
